                <p id="1">Appearance As birds, both males and females have the same type of plumage and coloring. Their heads are mottled in color, with small black spots dotting the area above the beak. The chick's wings and back are pale brown, the back also has four brown stripes running along its length.</p>
                <p>a pale yellow-brown stripe surrounded by smaller black stripes runs down the top of the head. Both male and female adults have predominantly brown plumage. However, the marks on the throat and breast,
Japanese lentils are grown in East and Central Asia, in areas such as Manchuria</p>
                <p> Most quail eggs are not pasteurized, meaning they have not been heated to kill harmful bacteria that may reside in the shell.
Because of this, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems should avoid lentil eggs or make sure they are fully cooked without a runny or gelatinous yolk before eating them.
In addition, if you are allergic to chicken eggs, you may also be allergic to quail eggs. You must practice caution.    </p>

                <p>Quail eggs look like small works of art.
Quail hens from domesticated strains are not exactly known for being good ‘broodies’ so hatching quail eggs in an incubator is a good option. If quail eggs are to be incubated by a hen it should only be attempted using the smallest bantam such as a Rosecomb or Sebright as quail chicks are very small and delicate and anything bigger would squash them.
</p>
                <p>
                  A peculiarity of quail eggs is that they don’t all hatch at the same time. Most will hatch on day 16 or 17 of an incubation period but it can vary between 15 and19 days and there can be up to four days between the first chick and the last chick hatching.

RAISING QUAIL CHICKS
Once the tiny chicks hatch they need to be transferred to a small brooder with a heat source, such as the 40Watt incandescent lightbulb we use for warmth. Quail chicks have very long legs for their body size and it takes a while before they are able to walk confidently. This is the phase when they are most likely to be trampled to death by a hen.

                <h2>After all</h2>
                <p>
Quail eggs are an unexpected alternative to chicken eggs.
They are small but packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
However, they are more expensive than chicken eggs. Also, most of these eggs are pasteurized, so pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems should only eat them if they are fully cooked.
Quail eggs are a healthy and delicious way to mix up protein sources in your diet.</p>
